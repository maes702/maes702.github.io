# About Me

Hello, 

My name is Joshua Maes I live in Las Vegas Nevada with my wife and three kids, I have a seven, six and four year old. 
I have been married for thirteen years. 

I am currently a freelance draftsman and plan expediter for local architects, engineers and contractors. 
I am also a full time student working towards my BS in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University. As
I am nearing the completion of my degree I am looking forward and enthusiastic about starting a new career. 

In my spare time I enjoy taking my family camping, fishing and hiking. I also like gaming and do so when my 
kids allow me to have a turn. I also enjoy working and upgrading my home. Since purchasing my home I have learned
and installed floor tile, wood flooring and carpet. Some of my other hobbies include, sketching, painting, tattooing.
I enjoy the challenge of creating and fixing.
