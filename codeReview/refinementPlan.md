# Refinement Plan

## Software design/engineering

##### Enhancement One

The Slide Show project was an artifact from CS250 which fall in the Software Design category. This code can be enhanced for more complexity as the initial code is limited. Since the project only provides slides for the top 5 destinations the program could also include filters for the slides such as top five destinations with-in a certain price. Being able to add functionality to the artifact demonstrates the ability to take a direction from an end user to improve an existing design/program.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

##### Enhancement Two

The Slid Show project from the CS250 class can also be used for this category (Algorithms and Data Structures). Due to the limited complexity of this project it can improves in several areas. In addition to adding a price range filter to the top 5 destinations query I can also include a filter to set a geographical location, in this case the country, so only the destinations withing a certain country would be shown. Additional filter will demonstrate my ability to modify algorithms and data structures in python language.

## Databases

##### Enhancement three

The MongoDb API restfule service was an artifact made in my CS 340 course some time ago. This artifact was used to enable my algorithm to be used as a data storage and retrieval applicaiton. I plan on updating the methods to create additional entries into the database and manipulate them using what I learned throughout the course. My ability to use create and use CRUD operation will be used and demonstrate my experience with databases.
