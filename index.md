# Professional Self-Assessment

Welcome to my ePortfolio. My name is Joshua Maes I am currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and will be completing the degree on August 23, 2020. This ePortfolio was produced as a part of my Computer Science Capstone course, CS499, at Southern New Hampshire University. Right out of high school I wanted to work with technology and computer so I became an architectural draftsman, while this profession was extremely informative in computer aided design it did not fulfil my desire to know more about how computers and programs work, so I decided to return to school and get a degree in Computer Science. 

In the pursuit of a my bachelor’s degree I have been exposed to several programming concepts, theories, languages and operating systems. I have learned about the software development cycle and how a project comes to fruition through planning, collaboration and imagination, in CS 250 (Software Development Lifecycle). The projects in this course required effective team work between all parts of the agile team. From project owner to the development team, all parts of the agile machine had to work together to achieve a common goal. I was able to query large databases containing data on the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company in, DAD 220 (Introduction to SQL). Through my specific queries and analysis I was able to provide the stakeholders of the company with a business model that was designed to increase sales online and at their restaurants. None of the skill I developed would have been as effective if I didn’t have a solid foundation on how to approach software design and algorithms. CS 310 (Collaboration and Team Project), helped me understand the SDLC to a greater degree. I was required to produce a pseudo code prior to producing my first line of code. This practice is essential when coding as it lays out how to approach the project. This class also utilized version control via bitbucket to collaborate with other students for code reviews. Once all the ground work was done J-unit test were implemented to make sure the Jukebox program worked as intended. The use of java was essential in this program and further my development with the language. I have been required to learn effectively and efficiently to adhere to the course expectations. The courses I attended have prepared me to become a contributing member to any team but most of all they have helped shape my interest and career goals. Going into this program I was not sure what I wanted to do but have  a desire to work in cyber security. I plan on developing my skill in programming in as many languages as I can but would like to start with java. I see the logic behind learning and experiencing software development to be a more effective security specialist.

 Being able to attend Southern New Hampshire University was a great honor for me and I am pleased to present my work for the Computer Science Capstone showcasing the knowledge, skills and expertise I have developed in code reviews, software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases. Each artifact required the mastery of the software development life cycle, and knowledge of coding best practices. The artifacts I have produced for the CS 499 Capstone course highlights and illustrates my professional development in java programming, collaborative team efforts in creating and the use of databases.
