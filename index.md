Welcome to my ePortfolio. My name is Joshua Maes I am currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and will be completing the degree on August 23, 2020. This ePortfolio was produced as a part of my Computer Science Capstone course, CS499, at Southern New Hampshire University. Right out of high school I wanted to work with technology and computer so I became an architectural draftsman, while this profession was extremely informative in computer aided design it did not fulfil my desire to know more about how computers and programs work, so I decided to return to school and get a degree in Computer Science. 

In the pursuit of a my bachelor’s degree I have been exposed to several programming concepts, theories, languages and operating systems. I have learned about the software development cycle and how a project comes to fruition through planning, collaboration and imagination, in CS 250 (Software Development Lifecycle). The projects in this course required effective team work between all parts of the agile team. From project owner to the development team, all parts of the agile machine had to work together to achieve a common goal. I was able to query large databases containing data on the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company in, DAD 220 (Introduction to SQL). Through my specific queries and analysis I was able to provide the stakeholders of the company with a business model that was designed to increase sales online and at their restaurants. None of the skill I developed would have been as effective if I didn’t have a solid foundation on how to approach software design and algorithms. CS 310 (Collaboration and Team Project), helped me understand the SDLC to a greater degree. I was required to produce a pseudo code prior to producing my first line of code. This practice is essential when coding as it lays out how to approach the project. This class also utilized version control via bitbucket to collaborate with other students for code reviews. Once all the ground work was done J-unit test were implemented to make sure the Jukebox program worked as intended. The use of java was essential in this program and further my development with the language. I have been required to learn effectively and efficiently to adhere to the course expectations. The courses I attended have prepared me to become a contributing member to any team but most of all they have helped shape my interest and career goals. Going into this program I was not sure what I wanted to do but have  a desire to work in cyber security. I plan on developing my skill in programming in as many languages as I can but would like to start with java. I see the logic behind learning and experiencing software development to be a more effective security specialist.

 Being able to attend Southern New Hampshire University was a great honor for me and I am pleased to present my work for the Computer Science Capstone showcasing the knowledge, skills and expertise I have developed in code reviews, software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases. Each artifact required the mastery of the software development life cycle, and knowledge of coding best practices. The artifacts I have produced for the CS 499 Capstone course highlights and illustrates my professional development in java programming, collaborative team efforts in creating and the use of databases.

## Artifacts

### Software Design and Engineering
##### Destinations Slideshow Narrative

   The Destinations slide show is a program that provides the end user with a slide show of possible vacation destinations they may be interested in. This program was created February of 2019 as part of Computer Science 250 and required the developer to consider user stories to produce a program that would give a travel agency a method to provide the end user a visual snapshot of a possible travel destination. 

The slide show program is is a neat program with a lot of potential to be updated with additional features. Initially the program only took images and text and applied them to a slide show in the order they appear in a loop. After some trial and error I was able to improve the artifact by taking including a string of code that will ask the user for a price they would like to pay. The program will then take that input and provide a slide show that show all possible destination with-in zero and the price provided. This modification showcases my skill in modifying an existing algorithm to include additional import tools as required for user input as well as declaring and initializing the additional variables as required to set the new slide show.

This assignment was very informative and humbling. I thought everything I learned would come flowing back to me but I needed to do a lot of research to remember syntax and semantics. Then there were hours of trial and error as I was not sure where to request the user input. After placement was determined I was able to get the program to work and provide a slide show that is representative of a price sorted slide show.

### Algorithm and Data Structures
##### Destinations Slideshow Narrative

The Destinations slide show is a program that provides the end user with a slide show of possible vacation destinations they may be interested in. This program was created February of 2019 as part of Computer Science 250 and required the developer to consider user stories to produce a program that would give a travel agency a method to provide the end user a visual snapshot of a possible travel destination.

The slide show program is is a neat program with a lot of potential to be updated with additional features. Initially the program only took images and text and applied them to a slide show in the order they appear in a loop. I felt since this program is for a travel agency it would be nice to be able to set a price and a way to set a location. 
The enhancements showcases my ability to incorporate methods that can take an input from a user and then use that input in other methods to only show the destination slides requested. The inclusion of this enhancement required me to make additional methods that specify a country of interest. Previously the program only looped through a list from start to finish but now with the additional and modified lists the program can provide specific locations withing a country. The algorithm is now able to provide a customized and personal user experience.

This enhancement was very educational due to the fact that I tried many different methods in creating the location filter. I try to write out a logical plan and then execute. In this case I tried a switch statement that I really thought would work to add the location filter but could not get the loop to properly show the slides. I then tried separating all the inputs into several smaller functions but that became very messy and still didn’t work. After many failures I took a break and continued to think of the program and decided to create new methods for retrieving the images for the slides and I did this by making small modifications to the existing method that was used. After that things began to move along faster. The main problem was I could not get what I imagined in my head in code and was trying to code outside of my existing skill set. After making the modified methods all I had to do was provide the necessary data for the specific countries for the loop to iterate through. Every assignment has been extremely humbling as they make me realize I still have a long way to go to get to the level I would like to be but I must say the small victories I had on this assignment made me very happy.

### Databases
##### MongoDb Narrative

The MongoDb API service artificat was used to enable my algorithm to be used a a data storage and retrieval application. Through a restful API service and the creating of various methods I was able to; creating, read, update and delete elements in the stocks collection withing the market database. These methods use a NoSQL database schema that provides quicker access to data via indexes and allow for automatic scalability. This artifact was created during my computer science 340 class last May.

I included this artifact into my ePortfolio because I believe it is a great tool for manipulating databases that is quickly growing in many areas of technology. It allows for faster more efficient queries and updates with the use of indexing and reduces the amount of processing power with the use of indexes. This artifact also show my ability to use the CRUD operations need to manipulate a database. To show case this in this project I updated the artifact to create a new “Company” in the database. This new company includes new field specific to the new company created. Along with the new creation of the company additional methods were created to find, update field and remove excess data.

Some of the pros of utilizing the MongoDb API includes the learning of a new type of database schema. It enforced prior teaching in python and it was my first time using the json language or more so utilizing json format files. I love learning new concepts and methods and this class artifact really made me think when creating the methods outlines by the assignments. The challenges I had with this artifact is not being able to test and query from the provided databases when making my improvements but I believe I have created methods that will work to deliver the CRUD operations. Once again I have learned I have a long way to go but I am pleased that I have the opportunity to show that I have some experience in using non relational databases.
